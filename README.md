# ALL-IN-ONE-APPLICATION

# Problem Statement 
All in one app where we can have complete smart services for university related 
to cleanliness, lost & found, canteen orders, event notifications, etc.
You think standing in the queue for ordering food and then waiting for the food
to get ready is wasting time? Yeah me too. How if we could just order the food
after (after the lectures/before reaching the canteen) itself and the food gets
ready before you get there.
So, you’ve found an earphone and not sure where you’re supposed to report it?
Found dirt in your classroom and don’t know the appropriate authority to report?
Could we just directly report this in the app and the appropriate authority will
take care of the situation.
